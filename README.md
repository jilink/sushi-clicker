# Sushi Clicker
Sushi Clicker is inspired by the famous game "Cookie Clicker" that you can try there : https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/
The goal is basically to get the most sushi you can, first by clicking and there by automation using all the power ups

# Webpack
This web application has been entirely made with webpack, it features loaders for js/jsx, css and svg pictures
You will also find multiple webpack configuration files, they are used depending on the npm command, one is for development and the other is for building the minified application to publish

# React
Only functionnal component has been used, react hooks such as useContext have been helpfull to access global data, the game also saves himself to the local storage everytime you buy a new power up

# Run the application

To run the application in development mode at localhost:8000 you can simply use
```bash
npm start
```

To build the application use
```bash
npm run build
```

___
Feel free to clone the app and make your own clicker very easily, it is pretty simple to use the components to create your own power ups.
